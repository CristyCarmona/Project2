# Project 2 

# Title: Food Analysis 

## Description:
In today’s world, the vast world of food choices we have within our reach can leave us overwhelmed on our food choices and how they contribute to our overall nutrition.
Fortunately, Food is very DATA oriented! The United States Department of Agriculture’s Food Composition Database has an extensive dataset that provides data for 
Categories and Subcategories of Foods that include nutrient content and caloric values.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                         
In this project, we provide the interactive means to explore data of this data set, for the user to understand the nutritional content and values of a large-scale food 
category data set. Additionally, so that the user understands the contribution of each nutrient, the interactive site provides descriptions of vitamins, minerals, and 
fats to answer questions on why each of these nutrients is important on our bodies.
